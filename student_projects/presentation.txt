What do we need in our presentation?

Theoretical explanation of thomas alg.
Implementation in Julia
Comparison to basic LU decompisition
Investigation of instability
more?

Thomas Algorithm is basically a simple version of Gaussian elimination

Introduction to triadiagonal  (me)
    - why care? 
    - what kinds of problems?
    - relation to rest of the course?

What is the Thomas algorithm (Jae)
    - how does it work?
    - instability

Application/coding (Sonny)
    -
